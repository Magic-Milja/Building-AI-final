# Growth spurt recognition 
Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
Growth spurt is a common factor for sports related injuries for young athletes. This machine would recongize the situation and let the athlete and coach know when and how to adjust training to minimize risk of repetetive strain injuries.
## Background
As an experienced figure skating coach I've seen many cases of growth spurt and strain related injuries within athletes of 10-15 years of age. Sometimes the training is too hard or too unilateral during growth spurt. Sometimes even the athletes themselves push too hard to reach their goals. Repetetive strain injuries might keep an athlete away from training for months or be a reason to stop training. Growth spurt increases the risk of different injuries and could perhaps be quite easily recognized with the help of regular measuring and machine learning. 
* problem 1: Disciplines that include a lot of jumping load the body in a way that might cause Oshgood-Shlatter or other similar-type repetetive strain injuries.
* problem 2: In disciplines that require extreme flexibility it is possible to stretch too hard and end up with an injury in joint growth site.
## How is it used?
Athletes in the age of 10-16 get their hight and back lenght measured once a month and insert their measures onto an app on their phones. When the app detects growth spurt, it gives that information to the individual and maybe the coach as well, so they can check the work load or exercises to be more suitable for that face of the athletes development. Also in the app there would be other information such as the athletes weight, age, train load, sport, start of menstruation. 
## Data sources and AI methods
The base data for this machine could possibly come from scientific research on growth spurt related injuries, or possibly from clubs or coaches who might have collected suitable data already. Different sports have their own typical repetetive strain injuries so many different sports and disciplines should be taken into account.
## Challenges
Growth spurt itself will be one of the easiest things to notice, it is quite simply just the measurements, age and start of puberty to take onto account. Train load or number of repetitions or stretching too much are much more vague and thus harder to measure, and they are more up to coaches, physiotherapists or doctors to decide what is too much. After all the athlete wants to develop in skills and qualities and cutting too much from training is not great either. Also privacy is an important question. Is it unethical for the coach to know when the athlete has her first period?
## What next?
What do I need to launch this app? Expertise from software developers as I am not one. Maybe people from Suunto, Polar or FitBit would be interested in a project like this. I think that after first working with data from young athletes and their injuries this could grow into something that also helps adult athletes and actually anyone who exarcises to avoid repetetive strain injuries.
